How to Paginate a Dataset with Simple Page and Page Size Parameters
To paginate a dataset with simple parameters, use the page and page_size parameters:

python
Copy code
# Example pagination code
page = 1
page_size = 10
offset = (page - 1) * page_size
current_page_data = dataset[offset:offset + page_size]
How to Paginate a Dataset with Hypermedia Metadata
Include hypermedia metadata in your response:

json
{
  "data": [...],
  "links": {
    "self": "/api/resource?page=1",
    "next": "/api/resource?page=2",
    "prev": null,
    "first": "/api/resource?page=1",
    "last": "/api/resource?page=total_pages"
  }
}
How to Paginate in a Deletion-Resilient Manner
Handle deletions in a resilient manner using stable identifiers and cursor-based pagination:

# Example cursor-based pagination code
cursor = get_last_record_cursor()
next_page_data = get_next_page_data(cursor)
